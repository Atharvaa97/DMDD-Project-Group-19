Project Name: Event Management System

Project Members:  Anshul Singh, Aditya Pravin Pande, Davleen Kaur Ram Singh Matta, Atharva Sanjay Danke

Project Overview:

In this project, our aim is to design an event management system that will help students to keep a track of all the events that are organized by various clubs or committees at Northeastern University. This system will enable students to register for any event they are interested in participating. Additionally, keeping a systematic record of many factors, such as the number of students, the number of events scheduled, the timeline of the events, etc., can assist the university in planning future events utilizing this information.

Purpose:

•	To maintain the data of events organized in the university campus by clubs or committees.

•	To collect data of upcoming events so that students may get to know about the events that will be occurring in the university.

•	Organizers will be easily able to manage the finances of the events.

•	For competition-based events, results can be accessed from the database.

•	For a particular event, event requirements can be saved in the database or can be referred to from the same events that occurred in the past.

Scope:

The event management system will consist of admin, students, professors, and other entities that will play a significant role in the design of this system. The system will enable the user to check the upcoming events and register for them accordingly. The complete information of any event taking place will be added to the system so that it becomes easier for both the university and college to keep a proper account of all the events. If suppose an event is a competition-based event, the data of participants, winners, judges, and other details related to the competition will be stored in the database.
